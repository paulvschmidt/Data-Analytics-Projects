Premise: In this case study, I was given the data of the past year of rides for a bike-sharing company called “Cyclistic”. Cyclistic has two main ways of paying for their services being either an annual member or a casual rider. Cyclistic wants to convert more casual riders into annual members so I was asked to see how “annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently” using the past years worth of data.

Data collection & Thought Process: I loaded the data into Tableau Public and started to verify the data given to me. While all of the “Ride Ids” were distinct and not null, some of the Start Station and End Station values were null. After some further investigation, I decided to keep those values in the dataset as many of the bike rides did not cleanly start or end at one of Cyclistic’s stations. After cleaning the data, I looked into certain measurable fields and tried to find some differences between member riders and casual riders.

Conclusions: I found that, on average, casual riders rode approximately twice as long as members for each ride. In addition, members rode more on weekdays and in the morning hours when compared to casual riders. This led me to the conclusion that members frequently used the bike sharing service as a way to commute to and from work. 

Suggestions: In order to potentially convert more casual riders to an annual membership, you could offer incentives to people who want to commute to and from work. Another way you could try to increase the number of annual members is by targeting the larger stations with a proportionally larger number of casual riders when compared to the entire demographic.
